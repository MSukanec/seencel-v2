# AI AGENT BEHAVIOR RULES
# This file is automatically read by the AI to understand project context and constraints.

## 1. GOLDEN RULE: The "Memory" File
- **ALWAYS** read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` at the start of a session or new task.
- **ALWAYS** update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` when you make a structural decision (e.g., adding a new library, changing a pattern, or defining a new UI rule).
- **DO NOT** wait for the user to ask you to update it. If you change the standard, update the doc.

## 2. Key Tech Stack Enforcements
- **Notifications**: MUST use `sonner` (`toast.success/error`). NEVER use inline text messages for status.
- **Inputs**: MUST use `PhoneInput` for phone numbers.
- **i18n**: MUST use `next-intl` (keys in `messages/es.json`). NO hardcoded text.
- **Database**: Respect RLS. Use `.update()` for profiles, not `.upsert()`.

## 3. UI/UX Philosophy
- "Enterprise Grade" is the standard. Animations, polished states, and handling edge cases (loading, empty states) are mandatory.
