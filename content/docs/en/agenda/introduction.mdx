# Planner

The **Planner** is your planning hub. From here you organize everything that needs a date, tracking, or coordination in your organization and projects.

The Planner offers **three view modes** over the same dataset, accessible from the toolbar selector:

| Mode | Purpose | Ideal for |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **List** | View events chronologically | Quick overview of upcoming items |
| **Board** | Organize tasks by status (columns) | To-dos, coordination, tracking |
| **Calendar** | Monthly grid with events | Meetings, deadlines, milestones |

---

## Where to find it

The Planner is available in two places:

- **Organization level**: In the sidebar under "Planner". Shows all events and tasks for the entire organization.
- **Project level**: Inside each project, under "Planner". Shows only items associated with that project.

<Callout type="tip" title="Automatic filtering">
When accessing the Planner from a project, events and cards are automatically filtered to show only what's relevant to that project.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="What is it for?">
The task board is meant for general management: ideas, to-dos, administrative tasks, team coordination. For construction-specific tasks (concrete pouring, masonry, etc.) use **Construction Tasks** inside each project.
